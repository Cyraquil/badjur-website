            <p>Quilmon is a Cobblemon themed modpack of Minecraft (1.21.1), but there is a twist to the modpack. It replicates
                classic Minecraft from the alpha and beta era, and it also keeps the features of modern Minecraft. The modpack keep mostly the vanilla part,
                but it also adds some challenges, quality of life changes and some improvements as it keeps that same base Cobblemon experience.
